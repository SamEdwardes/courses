# 1
No, the events could be mutually exclusive (e.g. event two will only happen if event one occurs)

# 2
No, we cannot have negative values, everything must be above zero.

# 3 
```{r}
pbeta(0.75, 2, 1)
```

# 4 
The point at which 97.5% of the observations are behind this point. This would mean that 97.5% of the time our observation will be less than or equal to the point.

# 5
```{r}
p_one_parent <- 0.15
pfather <- 0.1
pmother <- 0.09

# What is the probability they both have contracted it?

# We know that the probability of A or B is:
# P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A & B)
# 0.15 = 0.1 + 0.09 - x

# solve for x
0.1 + 0.09 - 0.15

```

# 6
The median should be 0.50

# 7 
Yes, b/c it is symetric, the easy explanation is that 50% of the data would lie above 0 and 50% would lie below.
