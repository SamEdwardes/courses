# 1
```{r}
p_one <- 0.17
p_father <- 0.12
p_both <- 0.06

# what is p_mother?

#P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) + P(A & B)

0.17 - 0.12 + 0.06

# answer = 0.11
```

# 2
0.75

# 3
x = heads I loose and give x dollars
y = tails I win and get y dollars
p = probability coin is heads

What has to be true about x and y to make sure that the game is fair (expected earnings of 0)?

```{r}
# In this case, we need the odds to be 1:1.
# odds = P(A)/P(B) or (1-P)/P or favourable outcomes over non favourable

# p(1-p) = Y/X

```
# 4
The median must be zero.


# 5
```{r}
x <- 1:4
p <- x/sum(x)
temp <- rbind(x, p)
rownames(temp) <- c("X", "Prob")
temp

# What is the mean?
apply(temp, 2, prod)
mean(apply(temp, 2, prod))

# I think this is right...
sum(apply(temp, 2, prod))

```

# 6
```{r}
numer <- 0.75*0.3
denom <- numer + (1-0.52) * (1-0.3)
numer/denom
```
