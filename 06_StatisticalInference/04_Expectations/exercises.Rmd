```{r}
p <- 1/6
1*p + 2*p + 3*p + 4*p + 5*p + 6*p
```

# 2
The mean is at 0.

# 3
The averge of the 20 distributions would also approximate u.

# 4
- heads = I win. 
- tails = friend wins.
- If I win, i get x dollars, if they win they get y dollars.
- odds that the coin is heads = d

What is your expected earnings?

expected earnings = -xp + y(1-p)

d = P/(1-P) so...

P = d/(1-d) so...


expected earnings =  x(d/(1-d)) + y(1-(d/(1-d)))

# 5
It would be centered at 3.5.
